# smallOS

`smallOS` is a lightweight cooperative runtime for priority-oriented task
management.

It is designed around three ideas:
- write tasks with modern `async` / `await` syntax
- keep scheduling policy owned by `smallOS`, not `asyncio`
- stay portable enough to run on desktop Python today and MicroPython boards
  later

## Status

The project is currently experimental but usable. The runtime core supports:
- priority-based cooperative scheduling
- task spawning, `join`, and `join_all`
- signal-based wakeups
- time-based sleeping
- readiness-based socket/I/O waiting
- generic TCP/TLS kernel hooks for higher-level protocols
- smallOS-native HTTP, Redis, MQTT, SSE, and WebSocket helper clients

## Why smallOS?

Python's `asyncio` gives great syntax, but it also brings its own scheduler and
event-loop policy. `smallOS` keeps the syntax while swapping in a custom
runtime, so tasks can be scheduled with project-specific priority rules and a
smaller portability surface.

That makes it a good fit for:
- robotics or device-control projects
- embedded experiments on MicroPython boards
- custom runtimes where task priority matters
- learning how coroutine scheduling works under the hood

## Installation

Desktop development:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
```

Run the test suite:

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

## Quick Start

Minimal desktop runtime:

```python
from SmallPackage.Kernel import Unix
from SmallPackage.SmallConfig import SmallOSConfig
from SmallPackage.SmallOS import SmallOS
from SmallPackage.SmallTask import SmallTask


async def hello(task):
    task.OS.print("hello from smallOS\n")
    await task.sleep(0.1)
    return "done"


config = SmallOSConfig.from_json_file("smallos.config.json")
runtime = SmallOS(config=config).setKernel(Unix())
runtime.fork([SmallTask(2, hello, name="hello")])
runtime.startOS()
```

## Configuration

The runtime now uses a first-class config object backed by
[smallos.config.json](smallos.config.json).

Current config fields:
- `task_capacity`: maximum tracked tasks / PID slots
- `priority_levels`: number of ready-queue categories
- `io_buffer_length`: buffered app output length when the terminal view is hidden
- `eternal_watchers`: keep the runtime alive when only watcher tasks remain
- `client_defaults`: shared defaults for cooperative clients and streams

Example:

```json
{
  "task_capacity": 1024,
  "priority_levels": 10,
  "io_buffer_length": 1024,
  "eternal_watchers": false,
  "client_defaults": {
    "stream": {
      "max_buffer_size": 16777216
    },
    "http": {
      "max_response_size": 16777216
    },
    "redis": {
      "max_response_size": 16777216,
      "max_nesting_depth": 32
    },
    "mqtt": {
      "keepalive": 60,
      "max_packet_size": 262144,
      "max_queued_messages": 1024
    }
  }
}
```

The config loader also accepts the aliases `oslist_length` and
`num_categories` so older notes and experiments can map cleanly onto the
current runtime.

Client constructors still accept explicit overrides, but when you create them
inside a task they now inherit these defaults from `task.OS.config` unless you
pass a value directly.

## Kernels and Board Profiles

Desktop kernel:
- `Unix`

MicroPython kernels:
- `MicroPythonKernel`
- `ESP32`
- `PicoW` / `RaspberryPiPicoW`
- `ESP8266` compatibility profile

You can either pick a board profile explicitly or let the runtime choose a
built-in profile from the firmware machine string:

```python
from SmallPackage.Kernel import ESP32, PicoW, build_micropython_kernel

kernel = ESP32(hostname="smallos-esp32")
kernel = PicoW(country="US", hostname="smallos-pico")
kernel = build_micropython_kernel()
```

## Demos

The new demos live in [demos](demos):
- [demos/unix_demo.py](demos/unix_demo.py):
  desktop scheduler demo
- [demos/esp32_demo.py](demos/esp32_demo.py):
  ESP32-oriented startup and optional Wi-Fi bring-up example
- [demos/pico_w_demo.py](demos/pico_w_demo.py):
  Pico W oriented startup and Wi-Fi configuration example
- [demos/micropython_autodetect_demo.py](demos/micropython_autodetect_demo.py):
  automatic MicroPython kernel selection
- [demos/runtime_demo.py](demos/runtime_demo.py):
  migrated home for the original root-level runtime showcase
- [demos/shell_demo.py](demos/shell_demo.py):
  scripted shell session running alongside other cooperative tasks
- [demos/redis_demo.py](demos/redis_demo.py):
  Redis example built on the native cooperative client
- [demos/http_demo.py](demos/http_demo.py):
  HTTP example built on the native cooperative client
- [demos/web_app_demo.py](demos/web_app_demo.py):
  cooperative single-thread web app demo with HTTP routes, live browser UI, and shell-driven server shutdown
- [demos/mqtt_demo.py](demos/mqtt_demo.py):
  MQTT example built on the native cooperative client

The original root demo remains available in
[demo.py](demo.py) as a compatibility wrapper around
[demos/runtime_demo.py](demos/runtime_demo.py).

## Runtime Model

`smallOS` is intentionally small in scope:
- tasks are `async def` coroutines wrapped in `SmallTask`
- task code awaits smallOS-owned awaitables such as `task.sleep(...)`,
  `task.wait_signal(...)`, `task.wait_readable(...)`, and `task.join(...)`
- the scheduler steps coroutines directly and decides when each task becomes
  runnable again
- kernels provide timing, output, and readiness-based transport primitives

This means arbitrary `asyncio` libraries are not drop-in compatible with the
runtime, but it also means scheduling policy and portability stay under your
control.

## Running on MicroPython

For MicroPython targets, the intended flow is:
1. choose `ESP32`, `PicoW`, or `build_micropython_kernel()`
2. optionally connect Wi-Fi through the kernel helper
3. build `SmallOS(config=...)`
4. fork tasks and start the runtime

The kernel layer is deliberately generic. Protocol clients such as HTTPS,
Redis, MQTT, RabbitMQ/AMQP, and Kafka should be built on top of the shared
TCP/TLS socket surface rather than requiring protocol-specific kernel methods.

## Clients

The current setup now includes first-party smallOS-native helpers for HTTP,
Redis, and MQTT, so users can stay inside the smallOS scheduler instead of
dropping down to raw sockets or depending on `asyncio`-owned clients.

Available helpers:
- `SmallHTTPClient`
- `SmallRedisClient`
- `SmallMQTTClient`

Current scope:
- HTTP: request/response helper with query params, JSON bodies, TLS, and
  chunked/content-length response parsing
- Redis: RESP command execution plus helpers like `ping`, `get`, `set`,
  `delete`, `publish`, and `subscribe`
- MQTT: MQTT 3.1.1 connect/disconnect, publish at QoS 0/1/2, subscribe at
  QoS 0/1/2, and inbound message receive with PUBACK/PUBREC/PUBREL/PUBCOMP
  handling as required by the protocol
- Both clients: optional username/password auth and TLS transport setup, with
  Unix support for custom CA and client certificate paths through
  `tls_ca_file`, `tls_cert_file`, and `tls_key_file`

notes, see
[SmallPackage/clients/README.md](SmallPackage/clients/README.md).
